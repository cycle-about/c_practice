This C program is causing a segmentation fault because the variables pmonth and pday in the main() function are not initialized to valid memory addresses before they are passed to the month_day() function.

In C, a segmentation fault occurs when a program attempts to access memory that it is not allowed to access, or when it tries to access memory that has not been allocated. In this case, the month_day() function is attempting to dereference the pointers pmonth and pday, which are pointing to uninitialized memory locations. This causes the program to crash with a segmentation fault.

To fix this issue, you can allocate memory for pmonth and pday using the malloc() function, or you can simply declare them as local variables and assign them values directly. Here's an example of how you could fix the program:

#include <stdio.h>

static char daytab[2][13] = {
	{0, 31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31},
	{0, 31, 29, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31}
};

void month_day(int year, int yearday, int *pmonth, int *pday);

int main() {
	int month;
	int day;
	month_day(2022, 41, &month, &day);
	printf("Month: %d, Day: %d\n", month, day);
}

// set month and day from day of year
void month_day(int year, int yearday, int *pmonth, int *pday) {
	int i, leap;

	leap = 0;
	for (i = 1; yearday > daytab[leap][i]; i++) {
		yearday -= daytab[leap][i];
	}
	*pmonth = i;
	*pday = yearday;
}

In this modified version of the program, the variables month and day are declared and initialized in the main() function, and the addresses of these variables are passed to the month_day() function using the & operator. This allows the month_day() function to modify the values of month and day in the main() function, and the program will no longer crash with a segmentation fault.
